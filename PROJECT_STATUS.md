### 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied
1. ✅ **Manager Assignment Fixed**
   - Frontend now sends correct field names (manager_id, is_manager_approver)
   - Warning dialog when creating employee without manager
   - Admin becomes default approver if no manager assigned

2. ✅ **Approval Flow Fixed**
   - Expenses auto-submit after creation (no manual submit needed)
   - Status correctly shows "pending_approval" (not "submitted")
