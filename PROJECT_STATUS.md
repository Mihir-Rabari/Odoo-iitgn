## 📈 Monitoring

- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** enabled in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Prometheus config at `monitoring/prometheus.yml` scrapes the backend at `host.docker.internal:3000/metrics`.

### How to run
- Start monitoring stack (requires backend running on port 3000):
  - `docker compose up -d prometheus grafana`
- Open Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin by default; change credentials later)
- Add/import dashboards as needed (e.g., request metrics for `http_request_duration_seconds`, `http_requests_total`, custom counters).

## 📝 Latest Updates (2025-10-04)

### 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied
