## üîê Method 1: Using Gmail App Password (Recommended)

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Click on **Security** in the left sidebar
3. Under "Signing in to Google", click on **2-Step Verification**
4. Follow the steps to enable 2FA (you'll need your phone)

### Step 2: Generate App Password

1. After enabling 2FA, go back to **Security**
2. Scroll down to "Signing in to Google"
3. Click on **App passwords**
4. You might need to sign in again
5. Select **Mail** for app, and **Other** for device
6. Name it "Expe Backend" or any name you prefer
7. Click **Generate**
8. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the 16-character password (it looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
9. Save it somewhere safe - you won't be able to see it again!

### Step 3: Configure Backend .env File

Edit your `backend/.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop       # The 16-char app password (remove spaces)
EMAIL_FROM=your.email@gmail.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false

# Frontend URL for email links
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 4: Test the Configuration

Restart your backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Try to sign up or login - you should receive emails!

## üìù Method 2: Less Secure App Access (Not Recommended)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This method is less secure and Google is phasing it out.

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
2. Turn on "Allow less secure apps"
3. Use your regular Gmail password in `.env`:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_actual_gmail_password
```

## üß™ Testing Email Functionality

### Test Signup Email:
```bash
# Using Postman or curl
POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signup
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "Test@123",
  "confirmPassword": "Test@123",
  "companyName": "Test Company",
  "country": "United States",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

### Test Login Alert Email:
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "Test@123"
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Invalid login: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted"

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure 2FA is enabled on your Google account
2. Generate a new App Password
3. Remove all spaces from the app password
4. Use the app password, NOT your regular Gmail password

### Problem: "Connection timeout"

**Solutions**:
1. Check if SMTP_PORT is set to 587
2. Make sure SMTP_SECURE is false (not true)
3. Check your firewall/antivirus settings
4. Try using port 465 with SMTP_SECURE=true

### Problem: Emails sent but not received

**Solutions**:
1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Check Gmail's Sent folder to confirm email was sent
3. Try sending to a different email address
4. Check email service provider's blacklist status

### Problem: "Application-specific password required"

**Solutions**:
1. You MUST use an App Password, not your regular password
2. Follow Step 2 above to generate one
3. Make sure 2FA is enabled first

## üîç Verify Your Configuration

### Check if emails are being sent (Development):

When running in development mode, check your console logs:
```
[info]: Email sent: <message-id>
[info]: Preview URL: https://ethereal.email/message/...
```

### Check Gmail Sent folder:

1. Open Gmail in browser
2. Go to "Sent" folder
3. Look for emails from your app
